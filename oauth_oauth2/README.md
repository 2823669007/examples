## Example information

This example is just the 'low-level' api, whichis like the original [goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) but converted to work with Iris. 

I recommend you to use the 'high-level' api,  [provided by this plugin](https://github.com/iris-contrib/plugin/tree/master/oauth) its [example here](https://github.com/iris-contrib/examples/tree/master/plugin_oauth_oauth2)
